I want this collection of exercises to enable a half-day session. There will be lots more than a half-day of content.

I'll teach this half-day at a conference, to get us going.

I want to make the content such that /anyone/ can use it â€“ in work, primarily, but also as commercial workshops or as fun sessions wherever testers gather.

I'm going to invite contributors. I'll accept exercises, feedback on how exerciese went, sources, and other ideas.
