I want this collection of exercises to enable a half-day session. I expect that we will end up with lots more than a half-day of content.

I'll teach this half-day at a conference, to get us going.

This is an open-source workshop. _Anyone_ can use it – in work, primarily, but also as commercial workshops or as fun sessions wherever testers gather. I hope that those who use it will contribute their insights into existing exercises – and will add their own.

I'm going to invite contributors. I'll accept exercises, feedback on how exerciese went, sources, and other ideas.
