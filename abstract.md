Do bored testers make bad testers? Are interested testers more observant and more innovative? Do they find more useful bugs?

If you've answered "yes" to those three questions, and you want to take fresh tricks back to your team, then come to this workshop! We'll use interactive group exercises to explore these questions and to understand how to maintain your engagement with what (and why) you're testing.

We'll start with exercises that expose the differences in working style between engaged and bored testers, and will build a collection of ways that we've kept ourselves interested. 

We'll have a look at incentives for cognitive work, and try out ways to introduce competition and game-playing into testing – then play games around resourcefulness and innovation for testers.

We'll discuss and experiment with a range of changes that can introduce novelty and diversity to our test focus and test approach, and look into the differences between dealing with a swift dull task, and maintaining interest into testing work over months or years. 

We'll use stories to spice up regression testing, and tools to crunch down bulk testing. We'll examine the role of feedback in learning, and the role of discovery and exploration in testing – and how team learning fits with individual engagement. 

We'll play with the way that empowerment and responsibility can be the foundation of engagement, and look at how observation and test design are enhanced by empathy and role-play. We'll look out for the chilling effects of zealotry and the dulling qualities of micro-management.

The workshop is built from a linked collection of group interactions and games. We'll move swiftly; exercises are designed to take around 20 minutes apiece. Exercises and teaching notes will be made available under an open-source license, and participants are encouraged to use, adjust and contribute their own to the repository.

###Take-aways

People who come to this workshop will return to their teams with a grab-bag of exercises and games built by testers, for testers, to help them re-focus and re-engage with their work.

They will also gain:
- Experience of energising exercises designed specifically for test teams
- An understanding of the diverse ways that one can sharpen up one's test approaches
- References and sources around ideas of motivation and engagement
