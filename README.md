Exercises for workshop on keeping testers interested

##Testers?
I think that a tester's engagement and enthusasm for their work has a great effect on how well they work. I think that effect is more pronounced for testers than for some other roles in development. I think that testing has the potential to be exceptionally boring, and that dull testing excludes interested testers, leading to a terrible cycle of ennui that is a drag on the soul of a team.

So I think that testers need special attention to help them stay interested.

And that's what this repository of exercises is for.

##Testing?
There are plenty of exercises and ideas for motivating people, and I expect that many here will be adapted from existing ideas. However, I want _all_ the exercises we keep in this repository to be relevant to testers and testing, in content, form, audience, aim, or some other facet.
